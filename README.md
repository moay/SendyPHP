SendyPHP
=================

A PHP class built to interface with the Sendy API ([http://sendy.co](http://sendy.co))

This package is derived from [jacobbennett/sendyphp](https://github.com/JacobBennett/SendyPHP) and removes the necessity to have open_basedir disabled in order to use CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION.

See the [original documentation](https://github.com/JacobBennett/SendyPHP) for further information.
